        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Mitchell Eddings. I'm a first year college student at Ozark Technical Community College for my
          Associates in Computer Science. During my time at OTC so far, I've learned how to proficiently work with HTML
          and CSS, become the Vice President of Leadership for our Phi Theta Kappa chapter, have joined four clubs, and
          so
          much more.</p>
        <p>Being an Apostolic Christian, I believe heavily in the Word of God, and the teachings of Jesus Christ and his
          Apostles. I also serve at my church through the music ministry as well as being the MC.</p>

          <p>My first job ever was as a dishwasher for a restaurant that's now permanently closed. While there's nothing
            exciting about that, my employer eventually recognized how reliable of a worker I am and moved me into a
            server position. Here, I was able to sharpen my communications skills and learn how to cooperate with
            different people. I also learned what to do when dealing with a rude customer.</p>

          <p>During 2021, the parents of a friend of mine reached out to me and asked if I could tutor their son. His
            teacher wasn't teaching the subject good enough for most of his class to understand, and my friend was
            falling behind. I would go to their house once a week for the next several months until he finally
            switched into a better teacher's class. During my time with him, his grade improved substantially, going
            from a 'D' to a 'B'.</p>
